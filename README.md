# What is Human Passport?

## Introduction

[Human Passport](https://passport.xyz) is a modular suite of identity tools that enable Proof of Humanity in web3 and beyond. It helps users verify that they are unique humans with meaningful [onchain](using-passport/onchain-passport.md) and offchain activity, without revealing any sensitive personal data.

While most users will only use the [Passport App (Stamp-based verification)](https://app.passport.xyz), Human Passport also offers additional tools for builders, such as [Model-Based Detection](model-based-detection/guide-to-model-based-detection.md) and [Data Services/airdrop consulting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDHGifo2IWkBxsMKcGJ2Qr24mnYM6G5hao7oin5f3OOZFkgw/viewform).

These tools support a wide range of use cases, from Sybil-resistant airdrops to identity-based governance. [Partners](https://www.passport.xyz/ecosystem) use Human Passport to ensure their programs reach real individuals, not bots or duplicate accounts.

Together, these features form a flexible system for verifying personhood and assessing trustworthiness in a privacy-preserving way.

## The Passport App: Stamp-based verification

You can access the Passport App here: [app.passport.xyz](https://app.passport.xyz)

Human Passport's primary offering is an identity verification aggregator that enables users to prove their [Unique Humanity](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/common-questions/what-is-unique-humanity) by collecting a variety of different [Stamps](stamps/what-are-stamps.md) (verifiable credentials) that represent activities that are easy for Humans to verify, but difficult for Sybils or bad actors to fake. These Stamps fall into the following categories:

* **Blockchain and Crypto Networks** -- Evaluate transaction history, trust graph participation, and other web3 participation and holdings
* **Government IDs** -- KYC via human.tech, Binance, and Coinbase
* **Social and Professional Platforms** -- Google, LinkedIn, Discord, and others
* **Biometrics** -- 3D facial liveness verification via human.tech

**Users can pick and choose which Stamps they verify**, meaning they don't have to use any Stamps they are uncomfortable with. Each Stamp comes with a weight, and the sum of all your verified Stamps makes up your Unique Humanity Score, which is then used by different partners to provide or deny access to their programs.&#x20;

A [score of 20 or above](using-passport/scoring-20-for-humans.md) typically means that the user is likely a unique human and should be able to participate in [partner programs protected by Human Passport](https://www.passport.xyz/ecosystem).

Users can also push their [Passport onchain](using-passport/onchain-passport.md) to participate in partner programs that are specifically built to verify unique humans directly on the blockchain.&#x20;

### Privacy-preserving technology

The Passport app is [privacy-preserving](https://www.passport.xyz/privacy). When users connect Stamps to their Passport, a verifiable credential is created to prove that the specific activity has been performed by the user. **None of the personally identifiable information is collected**. This is critical to user privacy, ensuring that no one will dox themselves by proving their humanity with Human Passport.&#x20;
