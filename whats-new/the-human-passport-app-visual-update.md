# The Human Passport App Visual Update

Weâ€™ve rolled out a new look for the Human Passport app â€” designed to improve clarity, accessibility, and overall user experience.

Hereâ€™s what changed:

### âœ¨ Updated Designs

The entire app interface has been refreshed with the new human.tech tone and design language. Itâ€™s simpler, lighter, and more consistent across screens, making navigation easier and more intuitive.

### ðŸªª Stamp Cards Got Better

Stamps remain the most widely used tool in the Human Passport suite. With the latest updates, Stamp cards now offer:

* Extended descriptions
* Step-by-step guides directly inside the card
* Clear info on verification time and cost

These changes help you understand what a Stamp does â€” and how to complete it â€” at a glance.

### ðŸ”‘ Login with Human Wallet

You can now log in to the Passport app using [Human Wallet](https://wallet.human.tech). It links directly with your Passport for smoother verification and usage.

### ðŸ†• New Stamps Added

Recent additions include:

* [Biometric Verification Stamp](../stamps/how-do-i-add-passport-stamps/the-biometrics-stamp.md)

More Stamps are coming soon, including options designed specifically for web3 newcomers.

You can always view available Stamps in your [Passport App](https://app.passport.xyz).

### âœ… What Stays the Same?

All functionality remains unchanged, including your existing verifications, scores, and linked credentials. This update is purely visual and UX-focused.
