# HUMN Points Program - heads up

Heads up, Chosen People 🪄

You already know something’s coming. Here’s your official heads-up.

We’re rolling out the first stage of the Passport Points Program, and you’ll be among the first to understand how it works.

***

### 👀 OVERVIEW

You’ll soon start noticing new Points in your UI. These aren’t tied to your Humanity Score; they’re something new. You’ll earn them by doing very human things, like:

✅ Holding high-value Stamps (e.g., Identity Staking, Human ID)

✅ Verifying other Stamps

✅ Minting your Passport onchain

***

### 📍 WHERE TO SEE YOUR SCORE

A new Points icon will appear in the top-right corner of your navbar. That’s where your HUMN Score will start accumulating.

When hovering over your score, you'll see the breakdown of your collection.&#x20;

### 🧩 POINTS FOR STAMPS

When verifying new Stamps, you will see your score increasing. You will gain 200 points per Human Key (i.e., per verified Stamp).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It's 100/Human Key for new users, but 200 in case of the multiplier (that you all are eligible to receive) — more about it later
{% endhint %}

You’ll earn _additional_ points by verifying selected Stamps marked with the HUMN icon — especially Human ID-powered ones:

* Phone Verification
* Biometrics
* Government ID
* Proof of Clean Hands
* Identity Staking

These will carry points you can collect. Specifically, 1,000 points each (2,000 in your case, thanks to the multiplier).&#x20;

***

### 🔢 POINTS ICON (+ OR NOT)

Stamp cards will now show a Points icon with a number:

* +1,000 means you’ve already verified the Stamp and collected points
* 1,000 (no +) means points are still available to collect

Simple as that.

### 🔗 MINTING ONCHAIN

Minting your Passport onchain also earns points:

300 points per chain — or 600 if you’ve got the multiplier 👇

***

### 🎁 2x MULTIPLIER

You probably already have a 2x multiplier (thanks to your high Humanity Score). That means:

* Your points are _already doubled_ throughout the UI
* Example: Minting shows 600 instead of 300 (no need to wait for extra doubling later)

If you're eligible for the multiplier, you will see it on top of your profile.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
2x multiplier only shows up in the tooltip and not in the rest of the UI elements
{% endhint %}

This program is a way to recognize your human presence, show appreciation, and maybe… unlock more down the line. At 70+, you're already deep in the game.&#x20;

Once the platform updates are live and you’ve had a chance to explore them, feel free to drop feedback here. If you spot quirks, edge cases, or have suggestions — we’re listening.
