# How to get GTC on your preferred network

To acquire GTC (Gitcoin's token), you can use several types of applications, typically decentralized exchanges (DEXs), centralized exchanges (CEXs), and crypto wallet applications.&#x20;

Using a DEX provides more control and privacy, while a CEX offers a more straightforward and user-friendly experience. Choose the platform that best suits your needs and preferences.



## Available networks

While you can also stake using the Ethereum L1 network, we specifically recommend that you acquire GTC on one of the following L2s, as the gas fees will be significantly cheaper:

* Optimism
* Arbitrum

## Guide to bridge GTC

While you can currently stake on Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum One, we recommend that you stick to a layer 2 network since gas fees will be cheaper.&#x20;

To get GTC on an L2, you will need to do a couple of things:

1. Get ETH on your preferred L2
2. Swap ETH for GTC on that L2

There are many ways to bridge ETH from one network to another. We recommend reading this guide to learn more:\
[How to Bridge to an L2](https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-use-a-bridge/)

Once you have ETH on one of our supported L2s, you can swap it to GTC on Optimism or Arbitrum using the following links:

* Uniswap: [Arbitrum One](https://app.uniswap.org/?chain=arbitrum), [Optimism](https://app.uniswap.org/?chain=optimism)
* Sushiswap: [Optimism](https://www.sushi.com/swap?chainId=10\&token0=NATIVE\&token1=0x1EBA7a6a72c894026Cd654AC5CDCF83A46445B08\&swapAmount=)
