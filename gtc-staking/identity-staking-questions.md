# GTC Staking on your Identity

GTC Staking (Identity Staking) is a mechanism that allows you to stake GTC to boost your reputation and/or boost the reputation of other people who you trust.

When you stake GTC through Passport (see the GTC Staking Stamp), it increases your Unique Humanity Score on Passport. This mechanism helps Passport defend against Sybil attacks and is another (very effective) step in making our fraud detection efforts more robust during our Gitcoin Grants Rounds.

Once GTC has been staked, the amount will be locked until the end of the Lockup period specified during Staking. You will need to return to the[ GTC Staking page](https://stake.passport.xyz/#/home) to reclaim your staked GTC at the end of the Lockup period.

To keep our ecosystem secure and trustworthy, we're introducing the ["Slashing"](passport-slashing.md) mechanism. This new feature will uphold network integrity by penalizing malicious actions, thereby increasing the Cost of Forgery for a Passport. By making it more challenging for bad actors to compromise our network, we ensure a high standard of security and trust within our community.

To get started please visit the[ GTC Staking page](https://stake.passport.xyz/#/home).

### Benefits of GTC Staking

* Increase Passport Score: Staking GTC increases your Unique Humanity Score, unlocking additional benefits and opportunities within the Passport ecosystem.
* Trust Signal: Staking acts as a trust signal, supporting the integrity of the web3 community by making it harder for malicious actors to create fake identities or engage in Sybil attacks.

There are two options for Staking your GTC.

* Self GTC Staking: You stake GTC on yourself for a specific period of time.
* Community GTC Staking: A member of the community stakes GTC on you for a period of time to verify your identity.

Community GTC staking helps us build a graph of trusted humans, which helps us distinguish between good actors and Sybils. To earn the Community GTC Staking Stamp credentials, you need to stake on more people and/or have more people stake on you.
