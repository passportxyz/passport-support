# GTC Staking FAQ

### What is Passport's Identity Staking?

Identity Staking is a feature within the Passport app that allows users to stake GTC tokens to verify their human identity. This initiative aims to deter Sybil attacks, enhance the utility of Passport, and promote a more secure and trustworthy web3 ecosystem by developing an [onchain trust graph](gtc-staking-faq.md#what-is-the-onchain-trust-graph).

### How does Identity Staking work?

Users can stake GTC tokens on their own identity or other trusted individuals within the Passport app. Staking GTC acts as a trust signal, supporting the integrity of the web3 community by making it harder for malicious actors to create fake identities or engage in Sybil attacks.

### Why is my staking Locked?

In order to prevent users from sybil attacking through staking their GTC and moving it across multiple passports during a Grants Round, all GTC staked is locked through the duration of the current Grants Round.

### Why should I stake GTC on my identity?

Staking GTC on your identity increases your Passport score, which can unlock additional benefits and opportunities within the Passport ecosystem and beyond. It's a way to verify your commitment to being a genuine participant in web3 spaces.

### What is slashing?

Slashing is an automated penalty mechanism that confiscates and eventually burns the staked GTC of users who violate Passportâ€™s trust protocols. This process helps maintain the community's integrity by deterring malicious behaviors.

### What triggers slashing?

Slashing can be triggered by behaviors that compromise the trustworthiness of the Passport ecosystem, such as participating in Sybil attacks or other fraudulent activities.&#x20;

### What is the Onchain Trust Graph?

The Onchain Trust Graph is a decentralized network that connects verified humans within the web3 ecosystem. It helps prevent fake identities, encourages community engagement, and supports decentralized governance.
