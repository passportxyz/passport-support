# Initiating GTC Staking with your network

### EMAIL

#### Subject: Let's Boost Our Web3 Reputations with GTC Staking ðŸŒŸ

Hey \[Friend's Name],

Hope you're well! I recently stumbled upon a great way to enhance our web3 reputationsâ€”GTC Staking via Human Passport.

The idea is simple: we stake GTC tokens on each other's identities, boosting our Unique Humanity Scores on Passport. This not only elevates our web3 standing but also helps Passport in anti-fraud measures.

For more details on how this works and what credentials we can earn, check out this[ support documentation](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/identity-staking-questions).

I plan to stake some GTC on your identity and would be thrilled if you'd consider reciprocating. This mutual action allows us both to earn new credentials and enhances our reputations.

ðŸš€ Interested? If you're up for it, please share the Ethereum address associated with your Passport so we can get started.

Best,\
\[Your Name]
