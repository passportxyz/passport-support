# Scoring 20, for humans

So, you’ve [created your Passport](creating-a-passport.md) and are working on building up your Unique Humanity Score to get access to a reward, governance platform, or community program.&#x20;

Now what?

This guide for humans will explain the easiest route to get a passing score, and will also link off to some other guides on how to verify other key Stamps and credentials on Passport. \


## High-score Stamps

The beauty of Human Passport is that it aggregates a variety of different human verification activities, enabling you to pick and choose whichever Stamps you are comfortable with to prove your humanity.&#x20;

We try to make this simple by weighing certain high-human signal Stamps heavily, so that you just have to verify a few Stamps to be able to participate in most partner programs, which require a score of \~20.&#x20;

Below are some high-point Stamps that you should consider verifying to quickly build up a score of 20.

## Building up a score as a crypto beginner

While many of the Stamps available via the Passport app look at your web3 activities and experience, there is also a clear path for users who are new to crypto and don’t have as much web3 history.

If you are new to the crypto-sphere, we encourage you to concentrate your efforts on verifying the following Stamps to build up a passing score.&#x20;

## Onchain History

It’s also worthwhile to note that we have several Stamps that look at your past transaction history. While these technically do cost money due to the gas fees that you paid to build up this transaction history, it’s gas fees that you’ve already spent.&#x20;

As an added bonus, these Stamps can be verified with 1-click.&#x20;
