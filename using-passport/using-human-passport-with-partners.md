# Using Human Passport with Partners

Connecting your Passport to gain access to a [partner campaign](https://www.passport.xyz/ecosystem) couldn't be easier.&#x20;

If an application uses Human Passport, it will display a "**Connect**" or "**Sign in with Ethereum**" button. Clicking the button will open a prompt to connect using your Ethereum wallet. Choose your wallet, check and sign the message that appears, and the app takes care of everything else.&#x20;

Behind the scenes, the app will send a request to your Passport score, review that score, and provide access if your score is above a threshold set by the partner (we recommend a [score of 20](scoring-20-for-humans.md)).&#x20;

* If you pass, you will gain access to the program or campaign that the partner is protecting
* If you fail, you will be asked to either build up your Passport score more via the [Passport app](https://app.passport.xyz), or choose a different verification method

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to sign in using the same Ethereum address that you used to create your Passport!
{% endhint %}

If you can't access content because your Passport score is too low, go back to the [Passport app](https://passport.gitcoin.co) and **verify more** [**Stamps**](../stamps/what-are-stamps.md)!
