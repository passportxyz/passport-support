# I have a Binance Account Bound Token (BABT) from Binance. Why can’t I claim the Stamp?

## Introduction

The Binance Account Bound Token (BABT) is a great way to build up points within your Passport. If you haven't already reviewed our guide on verifying this Stamp, you can do so here:

[How to add the Binance Stamp](../stamps/how-do-i-add-passport-stamps/the-binance-stamp.md)

## Reviewing addresses

This is likely because your Binance Account Bound Token (BABT) is linked to a different wallet than the one used for your Passport. Please check the following things to make sure this is set up properly:

1. Check which wallet you're logged into with Passport — you can see this in the top-right corner of the app.
2. Check which wallet you used within Binance to get your BABT. You can either do this via the [BABT site](https://www.binance.com/en/BABT), or by looking up your wallet via [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/) and look at your "Token Holdings" within the "Overview" section.&#x20;
3. Make sure your Passport address and your BABT address is the same.&#x20;

## Transferring BABT

If you accidentally verified BABT with a different wallet address than what you're using with Human Passport, you can follow these instructions to transfer the BABT and become eligible for this Stamp:

1. Revoke our BABT from your old wallet address.
2. Wait for 72 hours.
3. Then mint the BABT again on the wallet that you're using with Passport.&#x20;

## Verified Binance Stamp is showing a zero (0) score

If you've successfully verified the Binance Stamp and it is showing a zero score, this likely means that your Binance Stamp was recently verified with a different wallet address.

We describe this situation in the following guide:
