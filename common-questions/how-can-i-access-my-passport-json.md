# How can I access my Passport JSON?

### What is JSON, and why is it important for Human Passport?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. For Human Passport, JSON is essential because it allows seamless data exchange between systems, enabling smooth communication between apps and other external services.

You can specifically use this JSON to [access testnet tokens](https://faucets.pk910.de/) via one of our partner integrations.&#x20;
