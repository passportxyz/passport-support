# How can I increase my Passport score?

To increase your Passport score, you can verify Stamps within your Passport.&#x20;

Stamps are verifications of various aspects of your online identity and activities. The more verified Stamps you have, the higher your Passport score will be.

Remember, the score is calculated based on the Stamps in your Passport, with each Stamp having a [specific weight](../stamps/how-is-gitcoin-passports-score-calculated.md).&#x20;
