# What is a Stamp vs Credential?

**Stamp:** When we refer to a Stamp, we are referring to one of our \~20 partners who are providing verifiable credentials via the Passport app.&#x20;

**Credential:** Each Stamp can contain one or multiple credentials that represent a specific activity that a user can verify.

#### Example:

ETH activity powers one of Passport's higher scoring Stamps.

Within the ETH Stamp, multiple different credentials, each of which carry with them their own score weights:

1. ETH Enthusiast — 10 points
2. ETH Advocate — 2 points
3. ETH Maxi — 2 points

You can see what this looks like below:
