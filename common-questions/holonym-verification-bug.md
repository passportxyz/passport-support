# Holonym Verification Bug

First of all, on behalf of the entire Holonym and Passport team, we apologize for any challenges that users have had this week in verifying government ID or phone verification.&#x20;

If you need support, please review the following FAQs. If they don't address your questions, you can reach out to support by using the icon in the bottom right corner of this page.



## FAQ

### **Why am I getting an "Already Registered" error?**

If you receive an "Already Registered" message, it means you have already completed verification. Your only option is to request a [refund](https://docs.holonym.id/introduction/faqs/how-can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-holonym-kyc-or-phone-verification).&#x20;

**No sybils allowed**—each user can verify **only once** and submit a valid proof a single time. Any further attempts will result in errors. This rule ensures **Holonym's sybil resistance.**

### **What should I do if my wallet was hacked?**

We’re sorry to hear about your situation. Unfortunately, we cannot change your wallet address, as we do not support proof revocation. You will need to wait until your verification **expires in one year** before you can verify again. You may proceed with a [refund](https://docs.holonym.id/introduction/faqs/how-can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-holonym-kyc-or-phone-verification).

### **Can I verify with a different wallet?**

No, each user can verify **only one wallet per identity.** If the system detects multiple verification attempts with different wallets, they will all fail.&#x20;

**Do not attempt verification again.**&#x20;

Your only option is to request a [refund](https://docs.holonym.id/introduction/faqs/how-can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-holonym-kyc-or-phone-verification).

### **How can I proceed with verification after making a payment?**

If you've already made a payment, you can proceed with verification directly on the website without needing to wait or open a support ticket.

### **What should I do if I'm facing issues with the payment page?**

If you're having trouble with the payment page, try clearing your browser's cache and restarting it, then attempt again.

### **What if my verification was unsuccessful?**

If verification was unsuccessful, you can request a refund by reviewing our [refund guide](https://docs.holonym.id/introduction/faqs/how-can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-holonym-kyc-or-phone-verification).

### **Can I retry verification if my first attempt failed?**

You can retry verification at this point in time, and a previous failed verification fee will be automatically applied to your reverification.&#x20;

If you tried verification multiple times that resulted in failure, _you can collect a refund. See our_ [_refund guide here_](https://docs.holonym.id/introduction/faqs/how-can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-holonym-kyc-or-phone-verification)_._" Payment errors will automatically be addressed, but verification failures require user action (for refund or reverification).\
