# Shape Stack -- Proof of Humanity

Welcome to the Shape Stack Proof of Personhood Campaign support page. This guide will help users understand how to build their Unique Humanity score through Shape's [Custom Passport](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/using-passport/custom-passport-dashboards-and-scores) and earn Silver and Gold rewards by achieving specific score thresholds.

## Overview of Shape Stack Medals

Shape Stack uses the Human Passport framework to verify user identities and reward users with onchain medals based on their Unique Humanity scores:

* Silver Medal: Passport score of >10
* Gold Medal: Passport score of >20
* Gold Medal: ██ █ ████ ██ █████
* Gold Medal: Onchain Maxi (earn all credentials from the ETH and NFT Stamps)

These scores are achieved by collecting [Stamps](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/stamps/what-are-stamps) through Shape's [Custom Passport dashboard](https://app.passport.xyz/#/shape). Shape uses [onchain scores](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/using-passport/onchain-passport) for their rewards program, meaning users **must push their Passport Stamps and scores onchain to Shape** to be eligible for [Shape Stack rewards](https://stack.shape.network).

## Custom Passport and Scoring Details

### What is a Custom Passport?

Shape uses a Custom Passport to tailor the Passport experience for their users. This includes:

* **Branded Dashboard:** Shape users access a custom dashboard that reflects the branding and messaging of Shape.
* **Custom Scorer:** Shape adjusted the default Stamp weights to better fit their ecosystem's needs.
* **Onchain Scoring:** Users are required to push their scores onchain to participate in the rewards program.

### How Does Onchain Scoring Work?

Pushing your Passport onchain creates a tamper-proof record of your Stamps and score. The onchain score is used by Shape to distribute rewards on [Shape Stack](https://stack.shape.network) based on the following thresholds:

| Silver | >10                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gold   | >20                                                         |
| Gold   | Have a valid ID Stamp (Binance or Holonym)                  |
| Gold   | Onchain Maxi (Earn all credentials from ETH and NFT Stamps) |

## Steps to Push Your Passport Onchain

To participate in Shape's onchain rewards program, users must push their Passport scores onchain. Here’s how to do it:

1. Visit the Shape Custom Passport Dashboard:[ app.passport.xyz/#/shape](https://app.passport.xyz/#/shape)
2. Sign in with Ethereum: Use your wallet to authenticate.
3. Collect and Verify Stamps: Ensure your Stamps are up-to-date and valid.
4. Push Onchain: Use the "Bring Passport onchain" button at the bottom of the dashboard.
5. Pay the $3 Fee and Gas: Ensure you have sufficient ETH to pay for gas and the required fee to complete the transaction.

Once completed, your Stamps and score will be available onchain on Shape, and you can claim your [Shape Stack proof of personhood medals](https://stack.shape.network).&#x20;

## Shape Stack Scoring Breakdown

Shape uses a Custom Scorer to calculate Passport scores. Passport’s three identity-based Stamps award the most points, at 20 each, with other Stamps being available in the web3 and web2 categories.&#x20;

Several Stamps that you might find in the standard Passport app have been removed from the Shape dashboard.&#x20;

Below is the breakdown of the Shape dashboard’s Stamps and their respective weights.
