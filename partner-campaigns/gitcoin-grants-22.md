# Gitcoin Grants 22

**What is Passport XYZ?**

Passport XYZ is a decentralized identity (DID) platform designed to provide users with a single, reusable, and secure web3 identity. It allows individuals and organizations to manage their digital identities, permissions, and credentials across multiple platforms in a privacy-preserving manner.\


**How can I donate to Passport XYZ during GG22?**

To donate, visit the [Passport XYZ page on Gitcoin Grants](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/609/4) during the GG22 round (Oct 23rd - Nov 6th). You can make your contribution using supported cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, directly through the Gitcoin platform.



**What types of donations are accepted?**

Passport XYZ accepts donations in cryptocurrency through Gitcoin, primarily Ethereum (ETH). Other tokens supported by Gitcoin may also be accepted—check the platform for details on available donation methods.\


**What is the Sybil Resistance Strategy implemented by Gitcoin in GG22?**

There are two key components:

* Connection-oriented cluster matching (COCM): This method analyzes the donation patterns to identify the "uniqueness" of donations and reduce the impact of airdrop farmers or Sybil attackers who donate to the same projects repeatedly.
* Passport XYZ’s Model Based Detection: This tool reviews the onchain history of donors to boost the influence of users with legitimate onchain activities across multiple chains, increasing their contribution to the matching pool.

Together, these methods increase the accuracy of fund distribution by an estimated 20%. Learn more from the[ gov post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524).\


**Does this Sybil resistance mean new wallets won’t qualify for matching?**

Wallets without significant onchain history may not contribute to matching funds in GG22, but their donations will still go directly to the projects they support. We’re focusing on enhancing the web3 experience this round, and in the future, we plan to provide solutions for non-web3 natives, such as fiat on-ramping.\


**How does quadratic funding work in GG22?**

Quadratic Funding prioritizes broad community support. A larger number of unique donors boosts the amount matched by the funding pool, making every contribution valuable, especially small donations from more donors.



**Will I receive updates on how my donation is used?**

After donating, Passport XYZ will provide regular updates through Gitcoin and our other communication channels, such as social media and email, about how your donations are helping us grow and improve decentralized identity solutions.

\
**How does Passport XYZ use donations?**

Your donation will help us enhance our platform by supporting the development of new features, improving security, and expanding our decentralized identity solutions to make web3 safer and more accessible for everyone.

\
**Is there a minimum donation amount?**

There is no strict minimum, but small donations are encouraged as they help maximize the matching potential of quadratic funding. Every contribution helps, no matter the size.
