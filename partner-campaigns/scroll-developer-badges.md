# Scroll Developer Badges

This new campaign awards zk developers for their contributions to specific and relevant GitHub repos. If you qualify, you can earn new Scroll badges and associated onchain attestation that will be used to help inform Scroll hiring decisions and other use cases in the future.&#x20;

More specifically, these badges are checking GitHub accounts to see if 1, 5, or 10 commits had been made to one of the repos listed below. Depending on the volume of commits you’ve made, you’ll be awarded a different tier of the badges!

For this specific campaign, there are three different badges:

* zk Rollup Talent
* zk Infra Talent
* zk Privacy Talent

**ℹ️ One important thing to keep in mind:**&#x20;

_We are only looking for contributions made before October 1st, 2024. This means that any new commits to these repos will not count towards the badge. Please do not submit low quality commits to these repos._&#x20;

## How it works

To see if you qualify for one or multiple of these badges, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the following website:\
   [https://app.passport.xyz/#/campaign/scroll-developer](https://app.passport.xyz/#/campaign/scroll-developer)&#x20;
2. Sign in with your wallet.
3. Sign in to GitHub.
4. Passport verifies that you’ve made commits to the included repos.
5. You are then awarded the badge and can mint it onchain to Scroll

If you then choose to apply to a role with Scroll that requires one of these badges, they will be able to verify your contributions via your onchain badge.&#x20;
