# ☑️ The Idena Stamp

Idena is a network where users prove they are real individuals without revealing personal information, through a unique process known as "Proof of Person." At the heart of Idena is a fascinating concept: all users participate in a simultaneous test, known as a "validation ceremony," which occurs at regular intervals. This collective intelligence test requires users to solve puzzles that are easy for humans but hard for bots. This method positions Idena as a powerful tool for authenticating real human presence online. By connecting your Idena account to Passport, you strengthen your digital presence, assuring the community and platforms that you are a verified individual.&#x20;
