# ðŸ”Œ The zkSync Stamp



{% hint style="info" %}
As of December 2024, the zkSync Stamp has been merged with the Ethereum Stamp.&#x20;

The Ethereum Stamp now reviews your transaction history across not only ETH L1, but also zkSync, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.

If you have the zkSync Stamp still, it will retire after it [expires](../../common-questions/why-have-my-stamps-expired.md) from your Passport.
{% endhint %}
