### FAQ:

* **Why did I successfully claim the Stamp but the score was not added?**\
  When attempting to claim a Stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you already verified the same Linkedin account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified Stamp to expire. Each Stamp has a 90-day expiration.
