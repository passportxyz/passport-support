**Cost:** \~$5&#x20;

**Time:** \~5 minutes

**Validity**: 90 days Stamp / 1 year PoCH\


## Prerequisites

* A smartphone with a camera and the internet
* A current and valid government ID
* An Ethereum wallet with at least \~$5 on the desired network to cover both payment and gas fees
* A Human Passport account

## Available Networks

* Ethereum
* Optimism

## Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Step 1: Visit the issuance page**

Go to the [credential issuance page](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet/clean-hands).

**Note:** This attestation requires you to prove your identity first. If you’ve verified your identity with Holonym before, you will be redirected straight to **step 5**.&#x20;

#### **Step 2: Connect your wallet**

Connect your wallet to a supported network (Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche, or Base). Make sure your balance is greater than $5 to cover both the payment and gas fees, which vary by network.&#x20;

#### **Step 3: Scan QR code (desktop users)**&#x20;

Click "Verify now." If you’re on a desktop, scan the QR code displayed on your screen to use your mobile device’s camera. If you’re using a mobile device, continue directly with the camera.

#### **Step 4: Verify your identity with your government ID**

Follow the verification flow that includes uploading document photos and performing a liveness check. Some countries are excluded from verification - see details [here](https://documentation.onfido.com/guide/supported-applicant-countries/).&#x20;

#### **Step 5: Generate Proof of Clean Hands**

Click “Verify Now”, then “Continue”. Human ID will verify that you are not on any sanctions lists and are not a politically exposed person. Wait a few seconds until verification is complete.&#x20;

#### **Step 6: Mint the Soulbound Token (SBT)**&#x20;

After a successful sanctions check, mint the SBT to the wallet linked to your Passport. Click “Continue”, pay the $5 fee plus gas, and confirm the payment in your wallet. The fee is to be paid in the native currency of the chain on which you decided to mint.&#x20;

**Note:** Once the SBT has been issued, it cannot be transferred.

#### **Step 7: Verify the Stamp in the Passport app**

Return to the Passport app, connect your wallet, and click “Check Eligibility” to add the Proof of Clean Hands Stamp.

After 90 days, your Stamp will be automatically reissued without extra payment. After one year, when the Proof of Clean Hands expires, you will have to redo the verification process. &#x20;
