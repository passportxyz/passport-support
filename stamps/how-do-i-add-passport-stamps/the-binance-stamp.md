# ☑️ The Binance Stamp

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important note:** \
You can only verify a single Binance account with a single Passport account.&#x20;

Passport deduplicates Stamps verified across multiple Passport accounts using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method. This means that your verified Binance account will only provide points to the first Passport you verify.&#x20;

While the Binance Stamp on subsequent Passports can be verified, it won’t contribute to your score until the Stamp on the first Passport [expires after 90 days](../../common-questions/why-have-my-stamps-expired.md). Once that happens, points will be added from the next verified Passport in line.&#x20;

### FAQ

* **I have the BAB Token, why can’t I claim the Stamp?**\
  If your BABT is not linked to your Passport wallet, you will not be able to claim the Stamp. In step 7 above, ensure that the wallet address in the image (labeled 2) is your Passport wallet address. If it isn’t, that means that you have not linked your Passport wallet. You may need to revoke the token and re-mint it.
* **What can I do if I link the wrong wallet?**\
  You will need to revoke your current token and then mint it again on your desired wallet.
* **How do I revoke my token?**\
  Go to [https://www.binance.com/en/babt](https://www.binance.com/en/babt), scroll down to the FAQ section. You will see the option for you to revoke your token. Please note that once you revoke your token, you will need to wait for 3 days to be able to mint another one.
