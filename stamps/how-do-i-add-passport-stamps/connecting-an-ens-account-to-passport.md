# ☑️ The ENS Stamp

Enhance your web3 identity by connecting your Ethereum Name Service (ENS) account to your Passport. This guide provides a straightforward process for verifying your ENS Stamp, aligning your decentralized domain with your Human Passport activities.

Cost: ENS registration fees (variable) + Network fees

Time: 5 minutes

Validity: 90 days

Networks you can use: Ethereum

## Prerequisites

*   An ENS address held on the wallet address associated with your Passport.

    If you do not have an ENS account, you[ can buy one directly from the ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/)
* The ENS must be set as your primary name

## How to verify your ENS account

Ensure that you are eligible for the Stamp by browsing to [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/).&#x20;

Input your wallet address in the search field and press Enter.

If you get a result like this, where no primary name is set, or no names are found, you need to set your ens domain name as your primary domain. For information on how to set your primary name, please refer to [this help article from ENS](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890756-the-primary-name).

**Please note that ENS subdomains are not eligible for the ENS Stamp.**

The ENS name must also use one of the two default resolvers:

* 0x231b0ee14048e9dccd1d247744d114a4eb5e8e63
* 0x4976fb03c32e5b8cfe2b6ccb31c09ba78ebaba41

To verify your ENS account. Follow these steps

1. Go to [https://app.passport.xyz/](https://app.passport.xyz/) and "Sign in with Ethereum" to access your dashboard.
2. Click Connect on the ENS Stamp card.
3. Click “Check Eligibility” to claim all the credentials that you are eligible for.

### FAQ:

**Why did I successfully claim the Stamp, but the score was not added?**

When attempting to claim a Stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen in cases where the ENS domain was previously owned by a user who already claimed the ENS Atamp with it. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified Stamp to expire. Each Stamp has a 90-day expiration.
