## How Does it Work

A qualifying Gitcoin Grants round is an official fundraising event led by Gitcoin, where community contributions are pooled and matched to bolster the curated projects. Please note that while there may be other donation programs or rounds facilitated by various communities using the Gitcoin Grants platform, only those officially funded and conducted by Gitcoin qualify for the Gitcoin Grants Stamp.&#x20;
