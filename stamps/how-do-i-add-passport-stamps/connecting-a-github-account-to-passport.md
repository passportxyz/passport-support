# ☑️ The GitHub Stamp

Integrating your GitHub account with your Passport not only demonstrates your coding prowess but also enhances your visibility and credibility within the Passport ecosystem. This guide will navigate you through the process of verifying your GitHub account, detailing the steps to connect and the prerequisites needed for a successful integration.

**Cost:** Free ($0)

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Validity:** 90 days&#x20;

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account. If you don't already have one, you can create one on [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Stamp Requirements

* Only Commits qualify for the Stamp. No other contributions or activities will qualify.
* We track Commit days rather than the volume of commits. This means that if you make multiple commits on a single day, it will only count as one Commit day
* Only commits in the past 3 years qualify.
* Commits made while the repo was hosted by another Git platform don't count. The repo must be hosted by GitHub at the time of the commit for it to qualify.
* Commits to repos that are currently public qualify, regardless of whether they were private at the time of the commit.
* Your privacy controls can be set either to public or private

## How to verify your GitHub account

1. Go to [https://app.passport.xyz/](https://app.passport.xyz/)and "Sign in with Ethereum" to access your dashboard.
2. Click Connect on the GitHub Stamp card.
3. Click Verify.
4. You might get redirected to a pop-up window and prompted to:
   * Sign in to the GitHub account that you want to connect
   * Confirm the data that you will share with the Passport project
   * After confirmation, the popup window should close, and you will be redirected to the Passport app
5. Return to the passport browser window and confirm your account is now verified. You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say Verified.

### FAQ:

* **Why did I successfully claim the Stamp, but the score was not added?**\
  When attempting to claim a Stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you have already verified the same GitHub account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified Stamp to expire. Each Stamp has a 90-day expiration.
