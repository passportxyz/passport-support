# ☑️ The Coinbase Stamp

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important note:** \
You can only verify a single Coinbase account with a single Passport account.&#x20;

Passport deduplicates Stamps verified across multiple Passport accounts using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method. This means that your verified Coinbase account will only provide points to the first Passport you verify.&#x20;

While the Coinbase Stamp on subsequent Passports can be verified, it won’t contribute to your score until the Stamp on the first Passport [expires after 90 days](../../common-questions/why-have-my-stamps-expired.md). Once that happens, points will be added from the next verified Passport in line.&#x20;
