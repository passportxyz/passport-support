## How to verify your BrightID Stamp

Once you have received a verification on your BrightID account, you will be able to claim the Passport Stamp. If the verifications show “None”, you need to first [receive a verification](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/verifications) by attending a [connection party](https://meet.brightid.org/#/) to complete your verification.

Once you can confirm that you have met the requirements, proceed to the next steps:

1. Go to [https://app.passport.xyz/](https://app.passport.xyz/) and "Sign in with Ethereum" to access your dashboard.
2. Click Connect on the BrightID stamp card.
3. Click “Verify”.
4. You will be redirected to a new page where you need to scan the QR code from the BrightID app on your mobile device.
5. Once you scan the code, and you link Passport to your BrightID account, you can then click “Connect Bright ID”
6. Return to the Passport browser window and confirm your account is now verified. You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say Verified.

### FAQs

1. **I get the message saying “You are missing verifications: BrightID”, what does this mean?**\
   It means you need to first obtain a verification on BrightID before you can connect to your Passport. See [here](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/verifications) for how to obtain a BrightID verification
2. **I successfully verified the stamp but no score was added**\
   When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you already verified the same BrightID account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified stamp to expire. Each stamp has a 90-day expiration.
