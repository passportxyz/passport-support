# ☑️ The Lens Stamp

Passport recognizes your Lens Handle for verification points, not your Lens Profile.

## What is a Lens Account?

A Lens Account is your account on Lens, like a profile on other social networks. [More about Lens Account](https://dev-preview.lens.xyz/docs/concepts/account).

## How to Get a Lens Handle:

You can create a Lens Handle if you're part of the Lens beta or you can buy one from others, typically via NFT marketplaces.

## Where to Get Your Handle:

The official way is through the [Lens Claim Portal](https://onboarding.lens.xyz/). You can also acquire Handles on marketplaces like OpenSea, but ensure you're buying a Handle, not just a Profile.

## Steps to Verify:

1. Claim or purchase a Lens Handle.
2. Connect the Ethereum account of your Passport with your Handle.
3. Verify your Handle on [Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/).

Note: There might be a delay after claiming your Handle before you can verify it.
