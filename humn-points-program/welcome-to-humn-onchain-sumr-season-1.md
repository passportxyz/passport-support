### What is HUMN onchain SUMR?

**HUMN onchain SUMR** is our first onchain rewards program. It recognizes real, active ecosystem participants who show up with proof of humanity verified by [Human Passport](https://passport.human.tech/).

If you’ve used Human Passport before, collected Stamps, and scored 20+, you’re likely already earning HUMN Points!

### What are HUMN Points?

HUMN Points are the means to reward unique humans active in the human.tech ecosystem. Those points will be accumulated in the system and linked to your Passport wallet.&#x20;

**Note:** HUMN Points are not the same as your [Unique Humanity Score](../common-questions/what-is-unique-humanity.md) — the score of Passport's proof of humanity.&#x20;

* **Humanity Score** shows how complete your proof of personhood is, and how trustworthy you are in your claim of being a unique human being. You typically need a [score of 20](../using-passport/scoring-20-for-humans.md) to prove you're human and participate in the partner campaigns across web3. You also need a **Humanity Score of 20+** as an entry point to start earning HUMN Points.&#x20;
* **HUMN Points** are a separate point system, reflecting your verified presence and participation in the human.tech ecosystem, of which Human Passport is a part. You collect those points for completing various actions in the Passport app, like minting your Passport onchain or verifying [Stamps](../stamps/what-are-stamps.md). See the icon below? It's the visual representation we will be using to display HUMN Points across the app.\

**You have to build a Unique Humanity score of 20+ during the campaign to be eligible for future rewards**

### Season 1: Passport Points

The first season of HUMN Points focuses on your activity in the Human Passport app.

You can earn HUMN Points by:

* Reaching a Humanity Score of 20+ \[STRICTLY REQUIRED]
* Minting your Passport onchain
* Collecting Stamps
* Participating in Passport-integrated campaigns

You will see some actions on the platform marked with the HUMN icon and the point value rewarded for completion.&#x20;

HUMN Points are a gateway to potential future rewards. The more you interact with the Passport app, the more HUMN Points you score. Not all of the score-improving actions are marked.&#x20;

### How to Start Earning HUMN Points

1. Go to [app.passport.xyz](https://app.passport.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Check your Humanity Score (aim for 20+)
