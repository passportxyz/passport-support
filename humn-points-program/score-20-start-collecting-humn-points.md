# Score 20, start collecting HUMN Points

To start earning HUMN Points, you first need to pass the Unique Humanity Score threshold of 20.

### What’s the difference between HUMN Points and Humanity Score?

These two scores are related, not the same:

*   **Humanity Score (Unique Humanity):**

    Your existing score in the Human Passport app. It measures how strong your proof of personhood is, based on the quality, diversity, and trust level of your Stamps.
*   **HUMN Points:**

    A new rewards system that tracks your onchain presence as a verified human. It connects to the reward program — the [HUMN onchain SUMR](welcome-to-humn-onchain-sumr-season-1.md).

While some actions count toward _both_ scores (like collecting Stamps), the systems are different and not one-to-one.

### Why 20 is the human number

A Humanity Score of 20 or higher unlocks HUMN Points tracking. It's also the score typically required for partner campaigns protected by Human Passport — **the humanity threshold**.&#x20;

We continuously evaluate the [Models](broken-reference)' scores and[ Stamp weights](../stamps/how-is-gitcoin-passports-score-calculated.md) to keep the score of 20+ at the optimal balance between user convenience and Sybil resistance.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your Humanity score is below 20, you won’t qualify for the HUMN rewards, even if you collected some HUMN Points
{% endhint %}

### I’m a new user, and my score is below 20. What should I do?

First of all, welcome to Human Passport 👋🏼

Follow this guide to reach your **Humanity Score of 20**:

1. Connect your wallet at [app.passport.xyz](https://app.passport.xyz)
2. Collect Stamps from providers that you feel comfortable with; Stamps have different weights and costs of issuance
3. Aim for Stamps with high point values  (e.g., government ID, biometrics) if you want to build your score faster
4. Check your score after each Stamp to see your progress
5. Once you reach 20, you will automatically qualify to take part in the [HUMN onchain SUMR](welcome-to-humn-onchain-sumr-season-1.md) rewards program
