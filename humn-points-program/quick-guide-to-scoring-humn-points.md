### Step 1: Reach a Humanity Score of 20+

You _must_ have a Humanity Score of 20 or higher.

* If your score is below 20, you won't qualify for rewards.
* Not sure what this is? Learn more: [What is Unique Humanity?](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/common-questions/what-is-unique-humanity)

**How to increase your score:**

* Go to [app.passport.xyz](https://app.passport.xyz)
* Connect your wallet
* Collect verified Stamps (socials, identity verification, biometrics, onchain activity, etc)
* Choose the Stamps you're the most comfortable with&#x20;
* Watch your Humanity Score grow

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Score: 20+**\

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Step 2: Start earning HUMN Points

The dashboard at Human Passport App (app.passport.xys) displays your HUMN score on the top right side of the navbar

Hereâ€™s how to boost your score:

* Collect Stamps marked with the HUMN icon
* Mint Passport score onchain to multiple networks
* Perform other actions marked with the HUMN icon

If you completed some actions scoring HUMN Points while building your Unique Humanity score, you will already see these points on your profile.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You can track your HUMN Points in your profile â€” see the HUMN Points icon on the right side of the navigation bar
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Step 3: Check if youâ€™re eligible for a 2x multiplier

If you verified your humanity with a score of 20+ before 13 July at 23:59 UTC, you should qualify for a [2x HUMN Points multiplier](humn-points-boosters/returning-user-2x-multiplier.md).

If eligible, the multiplier will be visible on top of your profile in the Passport App.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Note:** if you are eligible for the 2x multiplier, the point values displayed to you all over the UI elements will already be doubled for you, compared to users without the multiplier
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Whatâ€™s Next?

HUMN Points will connect to potential rewards you can claim in the future.

Weâ€™ll release more information as the campaign progresses, including what the points are redeemable for and how the next seasons will work.
