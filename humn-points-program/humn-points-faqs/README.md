# HUMN Points FAQs

### [**❓**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **Is it necessary to score 20 or higher in order to qualify for HUMN onchain SUMR rewards?**

Yes. You must have a Humanity Score of 20 or higher at least once during the time of the campaign to qualify for rewards.&#x20;

Note: If you had a score of 20 before the campaign began, you might be eligible for the 2x multiplier. However, if you don't score 20+ at any time during the campaign, you will NOT qualify for rewards.&#x20;



### [**❓**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **Can I use multiple wallets to qualify for the HUMN onchain SUMR campaign?**

No. Using multiple wallets won’t help you earn extra points, and we do not allow it.&#x20;

Human Passport supports only one wallet per person. You won’t be able to transfer your Stamps or ID verifications to another wallet without losing eligibility on the first one.&#x20;



### [**❓**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **I scored 20+ before the HUMN Points program started, and I qualified for the Multiplier, but I never scored 20 at the time the HUMN onchain SUMR Season 1 was live. Will I qualify for rewards?**

No. Despite qualifying for the multiplier, it's required to score 20+ during the campaign itself to become eligible for the HUMN rewards.&#x20;



### **❓ Is it strictly required to mint Passport onchain?**

No. However, minting onchain gives you additional HUMN points. It signals your verified, onchain presence. You earn additional points for every chain you mint on.



### **❓ Does it matter which chain I mint my Passport on?**

No. All supported chains are valid. You’ll earn HUMN Points for each mint, so minting on multiple chains can increase your total score.



### **❓ What actions earn HUMN Points?**

You earn HUMN Points by taking certain actions within the Human Passport app.&#x20;

* Some of these actions are marked with the HUMN icon and the point value next to them.&#x20;
* Others silently score you points in the background. You will be able to see the overview of your HUMN Points sources while hovering over the HUMN icon in the top right corner.&#x20;



### **❓ Are HUMN Points and Humanity Score the same thing?**

No. These are two separate systems:&#x20;

* Humanity Score (also called Unique Humanity) reflects how well-verified and trustworthy you are — it's our Proof of Humanity score
* HUMN Points are part of a HUMN onchain SUMR rewards program based on your verified, onchain participation in the human.tech ecosystem

Some actions may impact both, but they are not interchangeable.



### **❓ When will I start seeing HUMN Points?**

Once we set the campaign live, HUMN points will begin tracking automatically. You will see your score in the top right corner, on the navbar.&#x20;



### **❓ I reached 20+, but I don’t see HUMN Points. What should I do?**

Please check the following:&#x20;

* Are you connected to app.passport.xyz with the correct wallet?&#x20;
* Has the app synced your recent activity?

Try reconnecting the wallet, clearing the cache and cookies, and if possible, re-try in another browser.&#x20;

If you still don’t see points, contact [support](../../need-support.md).



### **❓ I was verified before the 13 July snapshot. What do I get?**

If your Humanity Score was 20 or higher before the 13 July, 23:59 UTC snapshot, you qualify for a 2× HUMN Points multiplier.&#x20;

* This multiplier is automatically applied&#x20;
* You’ll see it displayed on top of your profile in the Passport App if eligible



### **❓ Can I lose HUMN Points?**

No. Once earned, your HUMN Points are locked to your profile. They won’t decrease.



### **❓ Where can I view my HUMN Points?**

You can view your points by connecting to app.passport.xyz. Once eligible, your HUMN Points will appear on your profile. Look towards the top right corner, in the navbar.&#x20;



### **❓ What are HUMN Points used for?**

HUMN Points are tied to HUMN onchain SUMR future rewards. Stay tuned for updates.



### **❓ Do HUMN Points expire?**

No. Your HUMN Points don’t expire and will remain associated with your profile.



### **❓ Can I transfer HUMN Points or multipliers to another wallet?**

No, HUMN points and multipliers are non-transferable.&#x20;



### **❓ Can I earn more by using multiple wallets?**

No. Human Passport is Sybil-resistant. Creating multiple wallets won’t increase your score.

Only one unique human earns points, regardless of how many wallets they control.



### ❓ If my wallet is hacked or I lose access, can I recover my HUMN Points?

Unfortunately no.&#x20;

If your wallet is compromised or lost, most HUMN Points cannot be recovered. Actions like identity staking may be redone from scratch, but early campaign bonuses and SBT-linked rewards will be lost.

We recommend:

* Using a secure wallet
* Backing up your keys safely
* Avoiding wallet switching during active reward campaigns



### ❓ What happens if my Humanity Score drops below 20 after I’ve started earning HUMN Points?

Nothing will happen as your HUMN Points as they do not expire. If you scored 20 or more at least for some time during the HUMN onchain SUMR Season 1 campaign, you will qualify for future rewards.&#x20;



### ❓  **If I have a 2x multiplier, do I see the amount of points multiplied across the dashboard?**

Yes. If you're eligible for the multiplier, **all** of your points will show doubled. So, if you compare your score with a friend who did not qualify for the 2x multiplier, they will see a lower amount of points per specific Stamp or action compared to you.&#x20;

For example, if your friend is claiming a Stamp worth 100 HUMN Points, you will see the same Stamp to be worth 200.&#x20;



### ❓  **What if I did not have a score of 20 on the day of the snapshot, but used Passport before and had 20+ in the past?**

You still qualify for the multiplier. We are looking for people who verified humanity any time BEFORE the snapshot was taken, not only AT THE TIME it was done.&#x20;



### ❓  **I'm from Ika campaigns. I minted free PoCH SBT for Ika airdrop. Does this SBT qualify for HUMN Points?**

SBTs issues for IKA qualify partially. While your verification is saved and valid, you will need to pay $5 to mint new SBT (on Optimism) compatible with Passport.&#x20;

Steps to take:&#x20;

• Go to app.passport.xyz

• Find Proof of Clean Hands Stamp

• Follow the steps to mint a new SBT on Optimism
