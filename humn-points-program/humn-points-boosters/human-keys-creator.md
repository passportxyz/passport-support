# Human Keys Creator

Whenever you verify a credential within the Passport app, you are creating a Human Key that represents that verification within the human.tech AVS, Human Network.&#x20;

As part of the points program, you will earn 100 points per Human Key created, meaning that each credential that you verify will earn you additional points.&#x20;

**What's the difference between Stamps and credentials?**

Within the Passport app, Stamps are the high-level organizing features that can contain multiple different credentials. For example, the Ethereum Stamp has multiple different credentials within it that you can verify, such as the ETH Enthusiast or ETH Maxi credential.
