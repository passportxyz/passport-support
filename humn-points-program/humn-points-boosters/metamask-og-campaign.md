### FAQ

**What if I don’t see the campaign in MetaMask Portfolio?**

* Only the wallets selected by theMiracle are eligible. If you don’t see an active airdrop in your MetaMask Portfolio, your wallet did not qualify.&#x20;

**What if I already have a Humanity Score of 20+?**

* If you've been selected as MetaMask OG, you’ll still receive the 1,000 bonus points once you log in through the MetaMask Portfolio airdrops.&#x20;

**How do I know if my bonus points were added?**

* Log into the Passport app and hover over the HUMN icon in the top-right corner. Your total HUMN points, including the bonus, will be displayed. We list all of the scoring artifacts and campaigns.&#x20;

**What is the 2x multiplier?**

* If you verified with Passport before SUMR launched, you may receive a 2x multiplier on your HUMN points automatically. This applies separately from the MetaMask OG bonus. Learn more: [returning-user-2x-multiplier.md](returning-user-2x-multiplier.md "mention")

**Can I participate with multiple wallets?**

* No. The campaign is restricted to wallets pre-selected by theMiracle. Only those wallets can claim the bonus.
