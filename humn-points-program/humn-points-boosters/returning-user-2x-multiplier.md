# Returning User - 2x Multiplier

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you're a returning Human Passport user, you're in luck. We are rewarding already verified humns with additional points!

A snapshot was taken on **13 July at 23:59 UTC.**

To qualify for the multiplier:

* You must have had a **20+ Humanity Score** at any time before the snapshot

If you are eligible, youâ€™ll see the multiplier displayed on the top of your profile, like in the image below.&#x20;

**What if you did not have a score of 20 on the day of the snapshot, but used Passport before and had 20+ in the past?**

You qualify for the multiplier. We are looking for people who verified humanity any time BEFORE the snapshot was taken, not only AT THE TIME it was done.&#x20;

Thanks for being an early Passport adopter ðŸ’š
