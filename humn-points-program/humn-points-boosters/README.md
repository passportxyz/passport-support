# HUMN Points boosters

We assign HUMN Points for different activities done at present and in the past on the Human Passport App. Typically, you will see a HUMN Points icon on the card of Stamps/actions that can help you score HUMN Points.

Some actions are more straightforward than others. Below, we explain some of those that may seem confusing at first.&#x20;
